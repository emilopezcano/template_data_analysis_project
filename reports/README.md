# Data folder

- This file is here basically to keep the folder syncronised with the template repository. 

- But it can be useful to document the files within the folder.

- It should be removed if not used once report files are in the folder.

## Notes

- The output file formats are ignored for repo synchronisation (see .gitignore file)

- For HTML output, consider using the `self-contained` option in source files, specially if you plan to share the report by e-mail.
